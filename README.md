# Threes v1.1
This is a the classic dice game of Threes.

Rules: 

Players start with 5 dice and roll them all to start the game.
After each roll, the player must pull at least one die.
That die contributes to their score and is removed and can no longer be rolled.
Roll and pull die until no dice remain. Threes count for zero points.
The player with the lowest score wins.

Notes:

If you select multiple die per turn, you MUST separate them by SPACES.
e.g. "3 3 1"

Players cannot "double down" in this version...yet.
